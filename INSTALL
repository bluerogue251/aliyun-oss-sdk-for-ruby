== Rubygems

The easiest way to install aliyun/oss is with Rubygems:

  % gem i aliyun-oss -ry
 
== Directly from git

 % git clone git://github.com/mangege/aliyun-oss-sdk-for-ruby.git
  
== Dependencies

Aliyun::OSS requires Ruby 1.8.4 or greater. 

It also has the following dependencies:

  gem i xml-simple -ry
  gem i builder    -ry
  gem i mime-types -ry

=== XML parsing (xml-simple)

Aliyun::OSS depends on XmlSimple (http://xml-simple.rubyforge.org/). When installing aliyun/oss with
Rubygems, this dependency will be taken care of for you. Otherwise, installation instructions are listed on the xml-simple
site.

If your system has the Ruby libxml bindings installed (http://libxml.rubyforge.org/) they will be used instead of REXML (which is what XmlSimple uses). For those concerned with speed and efficiency, it would behoove you to install libxml (instructions here: http://libxml.rubyforge.org/install.html) as it is considerably faster and less expensive than REXML.

=== XML generation (builder)

Aliyun::OSS also depends on the Builder library (http://builder.rubyforge.org/ and http://rubyforge.org/projects/builder/). This will also automatically be installed for you when using Rubygems.

=== Content type inference (mime-types)

Aliyun::OSS depends on the MIME::Types library (http://mime-types.rubyforge.org/) to infer the content type of an object that does not explicitly specify it. This library will automatically be installed for you when using Rubygems.
